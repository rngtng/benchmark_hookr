BenchmarkHookr
=================

Sometimes you need to know the specific runtimes of a certain block or method to find
the slow parts in your code.

This plugin allows you to hook into your rails/ruby code to monitor how long it took 
to execute a certain block or by what time this Line of code was reached.

just put hook( [message]) anywhere in your code to create a time mark or use the block version
to get the runtime of the whole block

hook( "my block") {
  block to execute
}

The final report shows timemark, runtime, percentage of time in current block, percentage
of time all over
